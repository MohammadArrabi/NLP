# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project – Missions 1 to 4

Welcome to this Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, a structured series of four analytical missions designed to demonstrate practical skills in text processing, information extraction, and language modeling using real-world political discourse data.<br>
Each mission is based on the **Knesset Protocols Corpus**, offering a realistic environment for performing NLP tasks ranging from frequency analysis to language modeling. This project showcases not only technical implementation but also the ability to deliver clean documentation and structured problem-solving - critical skills in any NLP or AI-related role.

##📄 About This Project
This project was created to apply and demonstrate core NLP techniques on real-world Hebrew text data from Israeli parliamentary protocols. Each mission presents a focused NLP challenge, encourages problem-solving, and results in documented solutions that follow best practices in code clarity and reporting.

**This repository is ideal for:**

- 📌 Showcasing your NLP and data science skills to employers

- 📌 Practicing and applying core NLP concepts

- 📌 Learning how to build structured, professional projects for your portfolio

## 🚀 Missions Overview

### 🔹 First Mission – Zipf’s Law in Parliamentary Discourse
> **Objective:** Investigate the word frequency distribution in the corpus and validate **Zipf's Law**.

- Extract and normalize words from Hebrew text.
- Plot and analyze word rank vs. frequency.
- Demonstrate power-law behavior statistically.


### 🔹 Second Mission – Stopword Filtering and Term Frequency
> **Objective:** Improve word frequency analysis by filtering out non-informative stopwords.

- Identify and remove Hebrew stopwords.
- Reanalyze corpus for meaningful keywords.
- Show how stopwords distort term frequency analysis.


### 🔹 Third Mission – Named Entity Recognition (NER)
> **Objective:** Recognize and extract named entities such as people, organizations, and locations.

- Apply rule-based or statistical methods for NER.
- Focus on Hebrew political discourse.
- Manually or automatically evaluate the performance.


### 🔹 Fourth Mission – Masked Language Modeling
> **Objective:** Predict missing words (masked tokens) in Hebrew sentences.

- Build or fine-tune a language model to fill `[MASK]` tokens.
- Compare model predictions with original sentences.
- Use transformer-based models like BERT or statistical logic.
